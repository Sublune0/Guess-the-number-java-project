Description
This program is a menu-driven number guessing game with two interactive modes:

1. The computer guesses your number
   - You think of a number between 0 and 100.  
   - The computer has up to 7 tries to guess it, using your feedback (`H` = too high, `L` = too low, `C` = correct).

2. You guess the computer's number
   - The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.  
   - You keep guessing until you get it right, with feedback after each guess.

3. Exit the program
