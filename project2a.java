* Assignment: Project 2A 
* Name: Benjamin Bever
* Date: 07/31/2025
*
* Program Description:
* This program shows a menu with three options:
* 1. The computer tries to guess the user's number.
* 2. The user tries to guess the computer's number.
* 3. Exit the program.
*
* Honor Code Statement:
* I affirm that this program is my own work and that I have not
* shared this code or provided unauthorized assistance with it.
*
* Purpose:
* To practice conditionals, loops, user input, and random numbers.
*
* Input:
* Menu choice, number guesses, and user feedback.
*
* Output:
* Messages that show if guesses are correct or not.
*
* Notes:
* - The computer has 7 tries to guess the user's number.
* - The user can keep guessing until they get it right.
